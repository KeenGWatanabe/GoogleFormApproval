Yes, you can use **Google Apps Script** to create a workflow where:
1. A Google Form submission triggers an email to an approver.
2. The approver responds (e.g., by replying with "Approve" or "Reject").
3. Based on the approver's response, another email is sent to the original submitter.

Hereâ€™s how you can set this up step-by-step:

---

### **1. Set Up Google Forms and Sheets**
1. Create your Google Form and link it to a Google Sheet to store responses.
2. Add columns in the Google Sheet for:
   - **Approval Status** (e.g., "Pending," "Approved," "Rejected").
   - **Approver Email** (the email address of the person responsible for approval).
   - **Approver Response** (to store the approver's decision).

---

### **2. Write the Apps Script**
Open the linked Google Sheet and go to **Extensions > Apps Script**. Write the following script:

#### **Script to Send Email to Approver**
```javascript
function sendApprovalEmail(e) {
  const sheet = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet().getActiveSheet();
  const row = e.range.getRow(); // Get the row of the new form submission
  const data = sheet.getRange(row, 1, 1, sheet.getLastColumn()).getValues()[0];

  // Extract form data
  const submitterEmail = data[1]; // Assuming the submitter's email is in the 2nd column
  const requestDetails = data[2]; // Assuming the request details are in the 3rd column
  const approverEmail = "approver@example.com"; // Replace with the approver's email

  // Send email to approver
  const subject = "Approval Request";
  const body = `Hello Approver,\n\nA new request has been submitted:\n\nSubmitter Email: ${submitterEmail}\nRequest Details: ${requestDetails}\n\nPlease reply with "Approve" or "Reject".`;
  MailApp.sendEmail(approverEmail, subject, body);

  // Update the sheet with the approver's email
  sheet.getRange(row, 4).setValue(approverEmail); // Assuming column 4 is for Approver Email
  sheet.getRange(row, 5).setValue("Pending"); // Assuming column 5 is for Approval Status
}
```

#### **Script to Handle Approver's Response**
You can use **GmailApp** to monitor the approver's reply and update the sheet accordingly.

```javascript
function checkApproverResponse() {
  const sheet = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet().getActiveSheet();
  const data = sheet.getDataRange().getValues();

  for (let i = 1; i < data.length; i++) {
    const status = data[i][4]; // Assuming Approval Status is in the 5th column
    const approverEmail = data[i][3]; // Assuming Approver Email is in the 4th column
    const submitterEmail = data[i][1]; // Assuming Submitter Email is in the 2nd column
    const requestDetails = data[i][2]; // Assuming Request Details are in the 3rd column

    if (status === "Pending") {
      const threads = GmailApp.search(`to:${approverEmail} subject:"Approval Request"`);
      for (const thread of threads) {
        const messages = thread.getMessages();
        for (const message of messages) {
          const body = message.getBody();
          if (body.includes("Approve")) {
            sheet.getRange(i + 1, 5).setValue("Approved"); // Update status to Approved
            sendResponseEmail(submitterEmail, requestDetails, "Approved");
            thread.moveToTrash(); // Optional: Move the thread to trash after processing
          } else if (body.includes("Reject")) {
            sheet.getRange(i + 1, 5).setValue("Rejected"); // Update status to Rejected
            sendResponseEmail(submitterEmail, requestDetails, "Rejected");
            thread.moveToTrash(); // Optional: Move the thread to trash after processing
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}

function sendResponseEmail(email, requestDetails, status) {
  const subject = `Your Request Has Been ${status}`;
  const body = `Hello,\n\nYour request for "${requestDetails}" has been ${status.toLowerCase()}.\n\nThank you!`;
  MailApp.sendEmail(email, subject, body);
}
```

### **3. Set Up Triggers**
1. **Form Submission Trigger**:
   - Go to the Apps Script editor.
   - Click on the clock icon (**Triggers**) on the left sidebar.
   - Add a trigger for the `sendApprovalEmail` function:
     - **Event Type**: On form submit.
2. **Time-Driven Trigger**:
   - Add another trigger for the `checkApproverResponse` function:
     - **Event Type**: Time-driven (e.g., every 5 minutes or hourly).

---

### **4. How It Works**
1. When a user submits the form, the `sendApprovalEmail` function sends an email to the approver.
2. The approver replies with "Approve" or "Reject."
3. The `checkApproverResponse` function periodically checks the approver's email for replies.
4. Based on the reply, the script updates the Google Sheet and sends an email to the original submitter.

---

### **5. Optional Enhancements**
- **Customizable Approver Email**: Allow the submitter to specify the approver's email in the form.
- **Multiple Approvers**: Modify the script to handle multiple approvers.
- **Slack or Other Notifications**: Use APIs to send notifications to Slack or other platforms instead of email.

---

This setup provides a fully automated workflow from form submission to approval/rejection and email notifications, all using Google Apps Script.
