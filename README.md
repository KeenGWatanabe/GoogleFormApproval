# GoogleFormApproval
Forms > Approval > Email
Automating Google Forms to handle form submissions, approvals, and email notifications can be achieved using **Google Workspace tools** like **Google Sheets**, **Google Apps Script**, and **third-party automation tools** like **Zapier** or **Make (formerly Integromat)**. Below is a step-by-step guide to set up this automation:

---

### **1. Set Up Google Forms**
1. Create your Google Form with the necessary fields (e.g., name, email, request details).
2. Configure the form to save responses to a **Google Sheet**:
   - Go to the **Responses** tab in Google Forms.
   - Click the green Sheets icon to create a linked Google Sheet.

---

### **2. Set Up Approval Workflow**
You can use **Google Sheets** and **Google Apps Script** to manage the approval process.

#### **Option A: Manual Approval in Google Sheets**
1. Add an **Approval Status** column in the Google Sheet (e.g., "Pending," "Approved," "Rejected").
2. Manually update the status for each submission as needed.

#### **Option B: Automated Approval Workflow with Apps Script**
1. Open the linked Google Sheet.
2. Go to **Extensions > Apps Script**.
3. Write a script to automate approvals based on specific criteria. For example:
   ```javascript
   function autoApprove() {
     const sheet = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet().getActiveSheet();
     const data = sheet.getDataRange().getValues();
     
     for (let i = 1; i < data.length; i++) {
       const status = data[i][3]; // Assuming the status is in the 4th column
       const request = data[i][2]; // Assuming the request details are in the 3rd column
       
       if (request.includes("urgent") && status === "Pending") {
         sheet.getRange(i + 1, 4).setValue("Approved"); // Update status to Approved
       }
     }
   }
   ```
4. Set up a **time-driven trigger** to run this script periodically (e.g., every hour).

---

### **3. Send Email Notifications**
Use **Google Apps Script** to send email notifications based on the approval status.

1. Open the Google Sheet and go to **Extensions > Apps Script**.
2. Write a script to send emails. For example:
   ```javascript
   function sendEmailNotification() {
     const sheet = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet().getActiveSheet();
     const data = sheet.getDataRange().getValues();
     
     for (let i = 1; i < data.length; i++) {
       const email = data[i][1]; // Assuming the email is in the 2nd column
       const status = data[i][3]; // Assuming the status is in the 4th column
       const request = data[i][2]; // Assuming the request details are in the 3rd column
       
       if (status === "Approved") {
         const subject = "Your Request Has Been Approved";
         const body = `Hello,\n\nYour request for "${request}" has been approved.\n\nThank you!`;
         MailApp.sendEmail(email, subject, body);
       } else if (status === "Rejected") {
         const subject = "Your Request Has Been Rejected";
         const body = `Hello,\n\nYour request for "${request}" has been rejected.\n\nThank you!`;
         MailApp.sendEmail(email, subject, body);
       }
     }
   }
   ```
3. Set up a **time-driven trigger** to run this script periodically.

### **4. Advanced Automation with Third-Party Tools**
If you want a no-code solution, you can use tools like **Zapier** or **Make (Integromat)**.

#### **Using Zapier**:
1. Create a Zapier account and connect it to Google Forms and Gmail.
2. Set up a Zap with the following steps:
   - **Trigger**: New response in Google Forms.
   - **Action**: Send an email via Gmail (e.g., to notify the submitter or approver).
   - Optional: Add a filter to check for specific conditions (e.g., if a field contains "urgent").
3. Activate the Zap.

#### **Using Make (Integromat)**:
1. Create a Make account and connect it to Google Forms and Gmail.
2. Set up a scenario with the following steps:
   - **Trigger**: New response in Google Forms.
   - **Action**: Send an email via Gmail.
   - Optional: Add conditional logic to handle approvals/rejections.
3. Activate the scenario.

---

### **5. Example Workflow**
1. A user submits a request via Google Forms.
2. The response is saved in Google Sheets.
3. An approver reviews the request and updates the status in Google Sheets (manually or via automation).
4. An email notification is sent to the user based on the approval status.

By combining Google Forms, Sheets, Apps Script, and/or third-party tools, you can create a fully automated workflow from form submission to approval and email notifications.
